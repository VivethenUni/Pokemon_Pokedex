# Pokemon_Pokedex
A pokedex in progress of being made by watching online tutorials and self learning how to use new things like fetching API's. Despite not completing the pokedex and falling ill during most of the time I spent working on it, I felt that I've gained a lot of valuable experience regarding the fetch API system and how it works. I look forward to potentially continuing this project during my spare time in the future. (Or I may just continue making my full pokemon game, either way I'm glad I tried this challenge out!)
